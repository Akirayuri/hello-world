# hello-world
A newbie's repository.

This is Akira. I know nothing about coding or programming. A one-year-old baby playing Jiggsaw is doing better than me.
So where do I start? Absolutely no idea. Since I am here at Github, guess I could use a hand or two. 
I'm not looking forward to becoming a legend. At least help me with my job. Maybe, just maybe one day I might get to scratch the blurred edge of this area and see the boots of the legends. At that time, I might be able to contribute a bit to this new world.

Thanks:D
